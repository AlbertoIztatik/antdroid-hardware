#Antdroid Hardware Components
Antdroid is a robot designed to be 3D printed.

It is designed in CATIA with a full parametric design. So easily you can resize and adapt your model to your owns servos or hardware requirements.

Unfortunately, you will need a license of CATIA to work with it. We would desire to port it to a free software solution but, at the moment, it is not posible.


## 3D printable parts
All parts are exported to stl format so you can easily print them.
